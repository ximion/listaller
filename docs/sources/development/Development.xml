	<title>Developing Listaller-ready applications</title>

		We created several standalone tools, the libuild programs, that are designed to help Linux developers write
		better software that runs on a wider variety of distributions. Most of them are independent of Listaller itself:
		you can use them even if you don't provide your software using the rest of our software.
