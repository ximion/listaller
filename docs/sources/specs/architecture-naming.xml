		<title>What are architecture names?</title>

		<para>Architecture names are strings like "x86_64" or "i686" which define the system-architecture of the current computer.</para>
		<para>
			Compiled programs can only run on the architecture they are built for. Therefore Listaller packages also need to be arch-specific.
			Unfortunately, there are quite a few architecture names around, e.g. for 64bit-PCs the vendor-neutral name "x86_64" or "amd64".
			For historical and compatibility reasons, Listaller uses the naming conventions described below.

		<para>
			Listaller uses the output string of the <command>uname -m</command>
			command for nearly all architectures, except for 32bit-PC and 64bit-PC architectures.
		</para>
		<para>
			For AMD's 64bit architecture, with the name "x86_64" or "amd64", we use the vendor-name
			<emphasis>amd64</emphasis>. Listaller will only use and recognize this name.
		</para>
		<para>
			For Intel's x86 architecture (names like "i386, "i486", "i686", ...) we use the name
			<emphasis>ix86</emphasis>. No other names are processed.
		</para>
		<para>For any other architecture, no special name changes are applied and we use the name which is exposed by the Linux kernel.</para>
