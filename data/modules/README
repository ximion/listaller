## Listaller software modules internal directory

Modules are software dependencies, which are required by other software to be run.
They can be libraries, artwork, Python-modules, basically everything which can be referenced
by a 3rd-party application.

Each module is described by a module-info file, which is shipped by the upstream project.
Since some projects don't ship these files yet, Listaller provides them for some commonly
used modules.

The module-info file format is described in Listaller's documentation.
