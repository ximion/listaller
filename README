Listaller 0.5.x

=== Compiling instructions ===

To compile Listaller, make sure that you have all required libraries (development files!) installed.
Then continue. (the build system will complain about missing dependencies)

You should use CMake directly to build Listaller:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. <flags>
Possible flags are:
 -DTOOLS=OFF -- Disable building of Listaller's command-line tools (libuild/lipa/etc.)
 -DLIBUILD=ON -- Build the LIBuild facilities
 -DPATCHELF=ON -- Build patchelf utility (we don't use this at time, so you usually don't want to enable it)
 -DVISUAL_LDD=ON -- Build the Visual-LDD utility (you need Qt4 for that)
 -DTESTS=ON -- Enable Listaller's basic Unit Tests
 -DTEST_DEPMANAGER=ON -- Enable test for Listaller's dependency solver
 -DTEST_SIGNING=ON -- Enable Listaller signing tests

=== Installation ===

To install the compiled binaries and required data files, execute
"make install" with superuser rights.
